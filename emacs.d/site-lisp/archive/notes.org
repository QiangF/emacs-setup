One of the other important differences between zip and tar is that zip compresses the data in
small chunks, whereas when you compress a tar file, you compress the whole thing at once. The
latter gives better compression ratios, but in order to extract a single file at the end of the
archive, you must decompress the whole thing to get to it. Thus the zip format is better at
extracting a single file or two from a large archive. 7z and dar allow you to choose to compress
the whole thing ( called "solid" mode ) or small chunks for easy piecemeal extraction.

to read a single file from a tar.gz or the like, you will need to decompress the whole gz stream
till the enough of the tar file is exposed so you can extract it. Zip allows you to compress and
pull out each file individually. 7z can have either behavior.

an extension to embed the indexat the end of the TAR file itself; any RAT-produced TAR file is compatible with standard TAR
